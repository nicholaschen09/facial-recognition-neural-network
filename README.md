# Facial Recognition System (Neural-Network)

This project implements a facial recognition system using neural networks in PyTorch. It includes preprocessing, training, evaluation, inference, and real-time recognition using a webcam.

## Features
- Preprocess images to detect and crop faces.
- Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for face recognition.
- Evaluate the model's accuracy on test data.
- Perform inference on individual images.
- Real-time face recognition using a webcam.
